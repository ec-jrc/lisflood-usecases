# Use case 3: the Nam Ngum river, Laos

As a third use case we will simulate the Nam Ngum river basin, a tributary of the Mekong River, for a period of 30 years. We provide both the basic data to run the model (input data, settings files, etc.) and a detailed explanation of how to build the model. 

## [Model](https://github.com/ec-jrc/lisflood-usecases/tree/mekong_usecase/LF_mekong_usecase/model)

In this folder you can find all the necessary data you need to run the LISFLOOD model of this catchment, i.e., the static maps, the meteorological forcings and the settings files. 

> **Important**. You need to unzip the [meteorological forcings](https://github.com/ec-jrc/lisflood-usecases/tree/mekong_usecase/LF_mekong_usecase/model/meteo) and the [population maps](https://github.com/ec-jrc/lisflood-usecases/tree/mekong_usecase/LF_mekong_usecase/model/maps/water_use/pop_daily.zip)

To run the model you need to have LISFLOOD installed in a Conda environment. Follow this [instructions to install LISFLOOD](https://github.com/ec-jrc/lisflood-code).


## Tutorial

We provide a detailed explanation of how to build the model, we explained the necessary input data, how to change the settings file and we visualize and comment on the results. You can follow this tutorial in two flavours:

* A Jupyter Book, which is a simple and clean way of reading the tutorial
* With Jupyter Notebooks, which allow you to interact with the tutorial, explore the inputs and outputs, edit, etc.
