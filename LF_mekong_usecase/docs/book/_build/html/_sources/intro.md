# A LISFLOOD use case: the Nam Ngum River Basin

This is a simple example of how a catchment model can be developed using the hydrological model LISFLOOD.

The book is divided in four chapters. The first chapter introduces the study area, shows the required input data, and presents the parts of the LISFLOOD settings file that will be common for the different simulations we will run. The following three chapters represent each of the three runs we will carry out in this project. In each section we will present the objective of that run, its specific settings and we will visualize and explain some of the results.

More information about LISFLOOD can be found both in its [Model Documentation](https://ec-jrc.github.io/lisflood-model/) and the [User Guide](https://ec-jrc.github.io/lisflood-code/).
